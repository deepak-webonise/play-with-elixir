  2. Pattern Matching
    a. Match
    b. use ful for destructing complex DS
        [head | tail] = [1, 2, 3]
        > head
        1
        > tail
        [2, 3]

  3. Pin operator
    a.Variables in Elixir can be rebound
      x = 1
      x = 2
    b. Use the pin operator ^ when you want to pattern match against an existing variableâ€™s value rather than rebinding the variable
      x = 1
      ^x = 2 //error
